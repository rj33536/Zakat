# Zakat : Charity Donation

Simplistic Web Portal designed to Generate Donations as Charity 

Problem Statment ----->> 
Most of the NGOs rely on monetary fund to collect and distribute donations like books, clothes and other accessories. 
This makes it really difficult for NGOs to survive and help people.

Ask at every doorstep for donations.
Get donation details online and collect them personally.
Distribute donations to people.
All of this collection and distribution work costs money.

Solution ----->>

We are proposing a new workflow which can revolutionize the way we donate. In our model we have omitted the costs of NGO in collecting and distributing donations. 
Anyone can refer a donation to a needy and the donator will then verify it.
Or, if the needy have a keypad mobile(a low-end mobile), then they can search for nearby donations and collect them personally.
